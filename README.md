'Frogger' arcade game
===============================

## Run the game
Open index.html in a recent browser. The latest versions of Firefox and Chrome
should work. This game probably won't run in IE due to lack of support of new ES6+ features.
Javascript has to be enabled for this game to work.

## Play the game
You control the player with either the arrow keys or WASD. The aim is to cross the road,
avoid the bugs and get to the water. If you win, you score a point and you can try again.
If you hit a bug, you lose a point and you have to start over.

You can earn extra points by rescuing the princess. She will appear randomly on the board and give you a point as thanks.
Sadly, she can't stay safe for long: when you win she will appear on a random spot again.

The game gets a little harder if you score a lot of points, and easier if you lose often.
This is done by changing the speed at which the enemies move.
