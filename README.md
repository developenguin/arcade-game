'Frogger' arcade game
===============================

## Run the game
Open index.html in a recent browser. The latest versions of Firefox and Chrome
should work. This game probably won't run in IE due to lack of support of new ES6+ features.
Javascript has to be enabled for this game to work.

## Play the game
You control the player with either the arrow keys or WASD. The aim is to cross the road,
avoid the bugs and get to the water. If you win, you score a point and you can try again.
If you hit a bug, you lose a point and you have to start over.
